# MonopileFailure
Matlab code designed to calculate non-linear behaviour of monopiles under cyclic loads in non-elastic soils. Uses Eulers Center Devided Difference Method to predict 'wedge-failure' of offshore monopile foundations. 

Please see final code in the 'FINAL' folder. Although not a finished product, the code for this MSc project recived high marks.
